Why this project: 

Working with the MERN stack - replacing NoSQL MongoDB with MySQL due to popularity and relevance to job postings.


Stack:

MySQL Database, Express framework for Node.JS, and currently Jade over React, although I'll swap over to React although Jade does have my interest currently


Next:

As you notice, the D, here MDERN is supposed to represent Docker.

Docker implementation planned to start tomorrow. It will let this turn into a deployable application. This is a great learning experience and is inspired by my job search and this forum [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/docker/comments/zgsaze/are_you_using_compose_for_local_development_flow/)
